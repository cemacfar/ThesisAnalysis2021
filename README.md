# ThesisAnalysis2021
Master's project analysis 

R script used for data analysis in the thesis: Bacterial and parasitic microbiome of howler monkeys: interactions and implications of human disturbance.

[FullThesisAnalysis.rmd](https://github.com/cemacfar/ThesisAnalysis2021/blob/main/FullThesisAnalysis.Rmd) contains all code used to organize and produce figures and statistical tests, as well as a general explanation of the code and results.

I intend to change the formatting from .rmd to .md as to display it in an easier to read file.
